## **Feautures**

- **Navigation Bar**

The Second Story Style shop features a comprehensive and intuitive navigation bar designed to enhance the user experience on both desktop and mobile devices. Anchored at the top of every page, the navigation bar remains fixed for easy access throughout the user's journey on the site. It incorporates the shop's name "SECOND STORY STYLE" on the left, serving as a home link for quick returns to the main page. Central to the navigation bar is a search functionality, enabling customers to effortlessly find vintage clothing and accessories by inputting keywords into the search box. 

For user account management, the navigation bar adapts dynamically based on the user's authentication status. Authenticated users have quick links to their profiles, wish lists, and a logout option, while visitors are provided with links to register or log in. The rightmost section of the navbar offers direct access to the wish list and shopping bag, with visual cues like icons and dynamic updates to indicate the current state of the shopping bag, including total cost. For mobile users, the navigation bar simplifies into a collapsible hamburger menu, ensuring that functionality is preserved without compromising the user interface.

Additionally, the site promotes a customer-friendly shopping incentive with a delivery banner that spans the full width of the page just below the main navigation bar. This banner advertises free delivery for orders exceeding a specified threshold, clearly communicating this benefit to customers and encouraging larger purchases. 

- **Dropdown Menu**

 Dropdown menu integrated into the navigation bar enhances the browsing experience by making it easy for customers to find products according to specific categories and preferences. Each dropdown is organized under clear headings such as "All Products," "Clothing," "Shoes & Accessories," and "Occasions." 

Under the "All Products" menu, users can sort items by price, brand, size, or category, allowing for a personalized shopping experience that can match different budgets and preferences. The "Clothing" section offers sub-categories like Dresses, Tops, Trousers, and Coats, providing quick access to specific product types. For those looking for footwear or fashion accessories, the "Shoes & Accessories" dropdown presents options like Shoes, Jewellery, Bags, and Hats. Additionally, the "Occasions" dropdown caters to customers seeking attire for special events, with selections such as Wedding attire and Ball Gowns. Each menu item is linked to a filtered view of products on the shop’s main product page, where customers can browse through items that meet the chosen criteria. 

- **Footer**

The footer of the Second Story Style provides easy access to the brand's social media platforms. Strategically designed to be both functional and aesthetically pleasing, the footer is featured on every page and includes prominently displayed social media icons that link to the shop’s Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and Twitter profiles.

Each social media icon in the footer is adaptive, changing color based on the page the user is currently viewing. On the homepage, the icons appear with a lighter design (social-icon-light), enhancing visibility against typically vibrant home page content. On all other pages, the icons shift to a darker theme (social-icon-dark), ensuring that they remain visually harmonious with the rest of the site’s design while still standing out to the user.

- **Favicon**

The website features a distinctive favicon, which is a small but crucial element of its branding. This favicon is derived from the Second Story Style logo, modified to include a vintage filter, enhancing its retro appeal. The use of a vintage filter on the favicon not only harmonizes with the shop's vintage clothing theme but also makes the site's tab instantly recognizable in a browser full of tabs. 

- **Home Page**

The home page of the Second Story Style website features an elegant and interactive design tailored to enhance user engagement and highlight the unique branding of the vintage clothing shop. At the core of the page is a "flip-container," an interactive element where users can click to reveal more information about the store. This container is strategically placed next to a prominent "Shop Now" button on larger screens, facilitating easy navigation to the product pages. All of this is set against a captivating background photo of a fashionably dressed woman wearing a hat, which reinforces the vintage theme of the shop.

On smaller devices, the layout adjusts for optimal viewing by stacking the logo and the "Shop Now" button vertically, maintaining accessibility and user-friendliness. To ensure clarity and maintain the focus on the content, the background photo of a fashionably dressed woman wearing a hat on larger screens is switched to a plain background on smaller devices. This adjustment enhances text readability and optimizes loading times, ensuring that the user experience remains seamless and engaging across all device sizes.

- **Products Page**

The Products Page features a clean and intuitive layout that effectively showcases the shop's diverse collection of vintage clothing. Each product is displayed in a card format featuring a clear image, a detailed description, and pricing information, ensuring that customers can easily navigate and identify items that capture their interest. This page also benefits from a dynamic sorting feature that allows users to organize the displayed products based on various criteria such as price, name, category, and size. This sorting is facilitated through a straightforward dropdown menu, enabling customers to tailor their browsing experience according to their preferences.

Interactive elements on the page enhance functionality and user engagement. Authenticated users can interact with wishlist and shopping bag buttons: clicking the heart icon on a product card adds the item to their wishlist and turns the icon red, signaling that the item has been added. If a user wishes to remove an item from their wishlist, a second click on the heart icon will remove the item, and the icon will change back to its original dark brown color. This provides a clear and intuitive visual cue for the user. For those not logged in, the wishlist button prompts them to log in, ensuring a seamless experience. The shopping bag button is available to all users, allowing them to quickly add items to their cart.

Additionally, a discreet "Back to Top" button is included to enhance navigation, making it easy for users to return to the top of the page after extensive browsing, further smoothing the shopping experience on the Products Page.

- **Product Detail Page**

The Product Detail Page on the website provides customers with a comprehensive view of each item, facilitating an informed and satisfying shopping experience.

Detailed descriptions accompany each product, including information on brand, price, size, and category, which helps customers make purchasing decisions.

For added convenience, the page includes direct links to filter products by category, enhancing the shopping experience by connecting customers with similar items. Superuser actions such as edit and delete buttons are discreetly integrated, allowing easy management for administrators directly from the frontend.

Additionally, the page is equipped with functionality to add items to the wishlist or the shopping bag. This process is streamlined through forms directly on the page, with options for authenticated users to add directly and prompts for unauthenticated users to log in. 

- **Add Product Page - Supersuser access only**

The Add Product Page is a specialized feature designed exclusively for superusers of the website, providing them with the capability to seamlessly expand the shop's inventory. This page facilitates the straightforward addition of new products to the catalog through a user-friendly form that is intuitively laid out for quick and efficient product entry.

The form is comprehensive, covering all necessary product details including name, description, price, category, size, and an option to upload product images.

The form is also equipped with multipart/form-data encoding to handle image uploads effectively, ensuring that high-quality visuals can be associated with each product.

A key interactive component is the ability to view larger images of the products via a modal pop-up, ensuring that users can examine their selections closely before proceeding to checkout.

Each item listed in the shopping bag includes a straightforward "REMOVE" link, allowing users to easily remove items directly from the bag without navigating away from the page. This function is supported by JavaScript to handle the removal asynchronously, ensuring a smooth and uninterrupted experience.

The footer of the shopping bag table provides a summary of the total cost, including individual item subtotals and delivery charges. It also dynamically informs users how much more they need to spend to qualify for free delivery, adding an incentive to increase their purchase amount. Below this summary, prominent buttons are displayed for "Keep Shopping" and "Secure Checkout," offering clear paths to either continue shopping or proceed to finalize the purchase. The "Secure Checkout" button is enhanced with a lock icon, reassuring users of the security measures in place.

- **Checkout Page**

The Checkout Page on the website is designed to streamline the process of completing purchases, offering a seamless and secure user experience. It is divided into two main sections: the Order Summary and the Payment Form. The Order Summary section provides a concise view of all items in the user's bag, displaying product images, names, sizes, quantities, and prices, along with the subtotal for each item.
